					Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates
					analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial
					intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from
					data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal
					human intervention(e.g. voice recognition and smart
					assistants). It is also used in internet search engines,
					E-mail filters to sort out spam websites to make
					personalised recommendations, banking softwares to detect
					unusual transactions.
